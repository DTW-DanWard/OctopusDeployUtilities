# Unit Testing Your Octopus Deploy Configuration

## NOT DONE!  COMING SOON!

I worked at a company managing the migration from an old, custom deploy system to Octopus Deploy.  There were 180+ services and thousand and thousands *and thousands* of variables.  Believe me when I tell you that organization and standards are critically important when setting up and maintaining your deployment system.  If you only have 3 projects with a handful of variables, then this might not seem important to you.  But as you grow it becomes *very* important; manually reviewing all your settings constantly for unexpected changes is just not an option.

Unit testing can help you with this.... 

basically reporting with validation in a particular structure

...


Example with all projects, Win Service Projects, IIS, etc.
